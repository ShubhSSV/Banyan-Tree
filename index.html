                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis) is revered for its numerous health and ecological benefits. Traditionally, it is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in Ayurvedic medicine. The bark, leaves, and roots are often used to treat various ailments like skin disorders, diabetes, respiratory issues, and digestive problems. Its sap has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, while the roots are used in remedies to boost immunity and overall vitality. Ecologically, the Banyan tree provides shelter and sustenance to numerous species of birds, animals, and insects, enhancing biodiversity. Additionally, it is renowned for its ability to produce oxygen, purify air, and help mitigate urban heat.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> The Banyan tree thrives in various climates but grows most actively in warm, moist seasons, especially in regions with pronounced monsoon periods. During the rainy season, it exhibits vigorous growth, expanding its aerial roots that eventually turn into trunk-like structures upon reaching the ground. Although it doesnâ€™t shed leaves in a specific season, it slows its growth during the dry winter season when it conserves water. The leaves generally remain green year-round, but new leaves typically sprout in the spring, giving the tree a fresh and vibrant look.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to the Indian subcontinent, the Banyan tree is widely found across tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. It is adaptable to a range of soils and climates, enabling it to grow in diverse regions from rainforests to arid plains. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it has also been introduced to other tropical areas worldwide, such as parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it serves both as an ornamental and a cultural icon.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Banyan tree is one of the longest-living tree species, with some specimens estimated to be over 1,000 years old. It grows slowly but steadily, expanding horizontally through its aerial roots that become supportive trunks, allowing it to cover a vast area over centuries. Due to this growth pattern, Banyan trees can attain impressive sizes, sometimes covering an area equivalent to a small forest. Its longevity and continual expansion make it a symbol of immortality and resilience in many cultures, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism, where it is considered sacred.</p>
